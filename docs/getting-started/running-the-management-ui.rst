Running the management UI
=========================

The Swagger UI is convenient for us as developers, but not particularly great for end users. Happily, Evelyn also has a management application that we can use to manage our toggles. 

The code for the management UI is in a `separate repository <https://github.com/binarymash/evelyn-management-ui>`_. If you've not already had a look, now might be a good time - `Read the docs <https://evelyn-management-ui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
