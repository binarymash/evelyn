Running the management UI
=========================

The Swagger UI is convenient for us as developers, but not particularly conveuseful for end users. Happily, Evelyn also has a management application that we can use to manage our toggles on a daily basis. 

The code for the management UI is in a `separate repository <8f73d020-96c4-407e-8602-74fd4e2ed08b>`_. If you've not already had a look, now might be a good time -  `Read the docs <https://evelyn-management-ui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
